# Analyzing-Global-Pharmaceutical-Drug-Spending-Trends.
This project aims to analyze global trends in pharmaceutical drug spending, focusing on variations over time and across different countries. By investigating these trends, we can gain insights into the economic impact of drug expenditures and assess the factors driving pharmaceutical costs.

## Dataset Description

The dataset chosen for this project comes from DataHub.io, detailing pharmaceutical drug spending data across multiple countries and years. It includes metrics such as country, year, total drug spending, and spending per capita, providing a comprehensive view of global drug expenditure trends.

## Summary of Findings

Our analysis reveals significant variations in pharmaceutical spending across countries, with notable trends showing steady increases in spending per capita over recent years. Countries with higher healthcare investments exhibit correspondingly high drug expenditures, suggesting a potential correlation between healthcare spending and pharmaceutical costs.

## Data Preprocessing

To prepare the dataset for analysis, several preprocessing steps were taken:
Missing Values: Handled missing values by either imputing or omitting incomplete data entries.
Data Transformation: Converted currency values and unified formats where necessary.
Normalization: Adjusted spending data to account for inflation and standardize values across different years.
